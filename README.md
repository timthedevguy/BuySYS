**NO LONGER MAINTAINED**
BuySYS is no longer maintained, I have lied to myself for over a year in that I would rewrite BuySYS in Python.  The fact is I haven't played Eve Online in almost three years and I don't see myself having enough time to dedicate to it or this project moving forward.

BuySYS
=====
BuySYS is an Eve Alliance/Corporation Buyback system.  The system is an offshoot of AmSYS https://github.com/binarygod/AmSYS.  I branched off and created BuySYS the idea of do one thing and do it well.  AmSYS grew to be very complicated and I wanted BuySYS to go back to the roots of a simple Buyback system.


#### Current Features

1. Members can Sell items to the Alliance/Corporation
2. Members can pull Market Information for any item in the game
4. Members can access a quick table view of current Buyback Values for various items
5. Admins can control the pricing of an Item or Group of items and specify different Tax Rates, Refining Options or set
a fixed price.

#### Current Installation

1. See https://github.com/binarygod/BuySYS/wiki/1.-Installation
